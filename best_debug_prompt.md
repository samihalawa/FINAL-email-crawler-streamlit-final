FIRST PLEASE READ THE COMPLTE FILE AND ALL ITS LINES AND FUNCTIONS AND BLOCKS LINE AFTER LINE


[LINT OUTPUT]
@Lint errors  (important: do not limit yourself to linting and do everything here said. Use thi as reference for doing all the other ,steps. DO NOT EDIT LINITNG DIRECTLY)

[SYSTEM CONTEXT]
You are Claude. Analyze and fix ALL workflow breaks systematically. Output  all the steps of the follwing secuence in your reply and output for each ALL required fixes.

[ALWAYS ANALIZE THE 100% OF THE CODE LINE BY LINE]
Each reply and step and affirmation must be based solely on the existng current code here completely from start to end. ach of the lines of the code must be analyzed and considered for each step of the analysis. NEVR EVER PROPOSE FIXES THAT ARE REDUNDANT!!!


[ANALYSIS SEQUENCE]

 you must output each part titled and correctly outputed  and eacÃ± page and block muust be addressed



----> 1. MAP APPLICATION STRUCTURE
- Pages/Views
- Navigation flows  
- State dependencies
- Data requirements
- User permissions

Reply concisely to the question: Is an app like this one in this language adn framework usually have this structure and parts? Detect any issues and output edit Composer fix block if some very fatal  element  or part missing or structure is wrong (like for example but not limited to: not ending in main for Streamlit apps, or not ending in </html> for html apps, etc)

-----> 2. UNDEFINED FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES AND VARIABLES

Reply to the question: how many undefined classes and functions and linting issues are? only when 0 then u can reply to me.


----> 3 FULL LOGIC GRAPH FOR ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS AND ELEMENTS AND WORKFLOWS OF THE COMPLETE FILE SO TO DETECT missing things adn broken things and missing and unreachable things etc

Fix: [Composer formatted edit fix for all the problmes derived from the Full Logic Graph ccording to how you have been told before Composer format works.]


---->4. LIST ALL HALLUCINATIONS AND NOT EXISIITNG MISNAME PACKAGES AND ATTRIBUTES AND LIBRARIES 

Fix: [Composer formatted edit fix for all from the list according to how you have been told before Composer format works.]

IF PLACEHOLDERS ALREADY IN THE CODE REPLACE ALL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY OR PLACEHOLDERS MISSING WITH FINAL LOGIC 

----> 5.  LIST ALL PLACEHOLDRS AND CODE LINES

Impact: [what fails]
Proof: [why it breaks]
Fix: [Composer formatted edit fix according to how you have been told before Composer format works.]
Note: The Composer format edit block must adjust all parts of the code related to what we are fixing here. Always include exact line number and action (add / remove / update - fix) in the comment at the top of each edit block.
