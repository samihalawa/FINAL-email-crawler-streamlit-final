So now I need to deploy to Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages and to HuggingFace Space the Python email search process and other things that may need longer running times.

So all has to work similar to this: when the automation AI is enabled it will be "manually searching" the search terms in groups, generating different variations of search term groups are like in batches proceeding with the manual search process (finding leads and emailing them).

The amount of time between those batches must be defined in loop_interval (so if it is 40, that means it will always iterate to the following search term after maximum of 40 leads for that search term) and max_emails_per_group (is the maximum number of emails per group. That means that in a unique run a group that exhausts that number won't be sending more emails -- so to distribute resources so for example if max_emails_per_group is 300, and we have several groups and some of them have many search terms and some not, that does not mean it will be sending to all of the search terms the 40 emails but when it reaches 300 emails will iterate to the following search term group.

If max_emails_per_group is not enough it can distribute the emails randomly or equitably (a setting also choosable from the Automation AI view, together with those other settings max_emails_per_group, loop_interval, loop_automation etc). If loop_automation is enabled then it will iterate again after all the groups have been contacted.

Automation must be stoppable at any time and resumable. Automation AI page must always be showing dynamically the process like in some logs. This must be visual and dynamic and animated, so user can at any time open the view and see the smooth visual beautiful and visually satisfying process of the automation even (like some beautiful logs of a control view that must be suitable for continuous monitoring, with real-time updates showing all the relevant information and progress in an engaging way).

Output a REFERENCE-extended version of the instructions optimized and enhanced by you (to attach as a file reference) and a version between 1800 and 1998 characters to directly send replit agent together with the attachment.
