Design a system that operates as a continuous automation loop for marketing campaigns. The system should leverage AI to analyze user-provided knowledge bases, historical runs, and relevant data to identify the most promising potential clients. It should automatically generate optimized search keywords and marketing content (such as emails) tailored for these clients.

The system should include the following capabilities:**
	1.	Automated Campaign Creation: Generate search keywords, email subject lines, and email body content using AI, based on the analysis of user knowledge and previous campaign performance.
	2.	Critique and Optimization: Integrate a self-evaluating mechanism where AI critiques the generated outputs and iteratively improves them for better results.
	3.	Automated Search and Lead Generation: Use the optimized search keywords to identify and scrape potential leads.
	4.	Content Sending: Send generated content (emails) to leads via an integrated email system, ensuring efficient communication.
	5.	Continuous Feedback Loop: Learn from each campaign iteration by analyzing results (e.g., open rates, click rates, replies) and use this data to optimize future campaigns.
	6.	User-Initiated Manual Search as One-Off Option: Allow users to perform manual searches and customize campaigns for specific use cases outside of the automated loop.

The system should work seamlessly, prioritizing full automation while allowing optional user interaction for individual tasks if needed. Ensure the AI operates within clear, optimized workflows designed to maximize potential client acquisition.
