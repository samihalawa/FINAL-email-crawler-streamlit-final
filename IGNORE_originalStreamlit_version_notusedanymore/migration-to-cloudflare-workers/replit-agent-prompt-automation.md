Enhance AutoclientAI with distributed automation using GitHub Actions as the orchestrator. Core requirements:

1. GITHUB ACTIONS ORCHESTRATION:
   - Scheduled workflows trigger search/email processes
   - Deploy components to:
     - HuggingFace Space (Python search/email)
     - Cloudflare Pages (Frontend)
     - Cloudflare Workers (API/State)
   - Centralized logging and monitoring
   - Automatic error recovery

2. BATCH PROCESSING:
   - Search terms grouped by category
   - Per-group configuration:
     - loop_interval: Batch timing
     - max_emails_per_group: Group quota (e.g., 300)
     - distribution_method: ["random", "equitable"]
   - Resource balancing across groups

3. MONITORING DASHBOARD:
   - Real-time process visualization
   - Live metrics and progress
   - Group performance tracking
   - Resource utilization
   - TV-display mode with flowing logs
   - Action replay for missed events

4. STATE & CONTROL:
   - Pause/Resume capability
   - Progress persistence in D1
   - Cross-platform state sync
   - Quota management
   - Group prioritization

5. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - State recovery
   - Alert notifications
   - Performance degradation detection

This approach:
- Keeps codebase unified in main repo
- Uses GitHub Actions for orchestration
- Maintains distributed processing benefits
- Simplifies deployment/monitoring
- Enables better version control
- Provides built-in CI/CD
